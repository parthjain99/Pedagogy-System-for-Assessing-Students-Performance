# Pedagogy-System-for-Assessing-Students-Performance
Game-based learning is an approach to learning where gaming concepts are implanted in
learning tasks designed by teachers. Here, learning activities boost a student’s commitment
and inspiration to learn. Components of game-based learning include quizzes, point system,
leader board, and classroom response systems. Game-based learning is additionally a
functioning learning method where games are utilized to improve student’s learning. With
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, various changes have been seen in the field of education.
Physical classrooms have been converted into online lectures. Paper based tests have been
replaced with online quizzes and assessments. In such a situation, Game-Based Learning
has proven to be a pragmatic option for improving a student’s assessment where paperbased evaluation is not possible. Various Game-Based Learning Systems have been built
previously, however none of them gives a complete set of all the features without being
exorbitantly expensive. So, we aspire to assemble a plausible and secure teaching project
where all aspects would be accommodated in a single and straightforward application
required for the complete assessment of every student. This system cuts down the workload
of teachers by creating a test by scanning the questions with the help of Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) and Speech-To-Text Recognition technique so that the teacher need not
type the question and thus reducing the test creation time and efforts. It also reduces the
teacher’s workload by assessing the students based on their scores.
